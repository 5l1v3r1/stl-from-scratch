stl from scratch
----------------

This repository contains the source code for my blog post series [STL From
Scratch][1] (you should follow that link for the
introductory post).

The plan for the project is to follow this timeline:

* Chapter 0 - utilities and iterators
    - pairs, tuples, and integer sequences
    - reference wrappers
    - function objects
    - iterators and range/container access
    - iterator operations and adaptors

* Chapter 1 - algorithms
    - minimums, maximums, and permutations
    - non-modifying sequence operations
    - modifying sequence operations
    - partitioning and sorting algorithms
    - searching algorithms
    - set algorithms
    - heap algorithms
    - numeric algorithms

* Chapter 2 - data structures
    - array
    - time travel to Chapter 5: allocators
    - string
    - vector
    - deques
    - forward_list and list
    - abstract data types part 1:  stack
    - abstract data types part 2: queue, and priority queue
    - time travel to Chapter 5: hashing
    - set and unordered_set
    - multiset and unordered_multiset
    - map and unordered_map
    - multimap and unordered_multimap

* Chapter 3 - input and output
    - motivation and demotivation - why and why not iostreams?
    - buffers of various sorts - streambuf, filebuf, and stringbuf
    - base classes - ios_base and basic_ios
    - i/o manipulators
    - input streams
    - output streams
    - file streams
    - string streams

* Chapter 4 - future STL components
    - motivation for more expressive types
    - optional
    - variant
    - any

* Chapter 5 - Miscellany
    - allocators
    - hashing
    - regex
    - atomics
    - chrono
    - locks and condition variables
    - threads
    - async, tasks, and futures
